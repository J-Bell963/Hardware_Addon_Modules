# Hardware Addon Modules

These addon modules provide discrete hardware functionality needed to support common design patterns when building IoT applications. We have created them to help shorten your time to market by providing composable, drop-in modules that allow you to quickly put together custom hardware for your solutions.

All modules are 100% open source.
