### IO Information

* **`3V3`** - Provides up to `2A` of `3.3V` power from the onboard switching power supply.
* **`VBUS`** - Provides a `5V` reference signal from the USB `5V` rail only when `3V3_EN` is enabled (pulled-high). Connect to the `USB_VBUS` pin on the Core-Compute module.
* **`3V3_EN`** - Enables the `3.3V` switching power supply. Pull to ground to turn disable.
* **`F7_RST`** - Connected to the `RESET` button on the board. Connect to the `F7_RST` IO on the Core-Compute to provide reset via button functionality.
* **`USB_D_P` & `USB_D_N`** - USB differential pairs. Requires a `90Î©` controlled-impedance differential pair to the Core-Compute module.
* **`F7_Boot`** - Connected to the `BOOT` button on the board. Connect to the `F7_Boot` IO on the Core-Compute to provide DFU boot capabiltiies.
* **`5V`** - Direct connection to the `5V` power supply from the USB.

### Power

Includes an `NCP1597AMNTWG` switching power supply that outputs up to `2A` of `3.3V` voltage, as well as passing through `5V` from the USB.
